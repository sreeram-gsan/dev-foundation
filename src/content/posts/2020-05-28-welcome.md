Hello,

Thanks for dropping by. For a very long time, I wanted to start a blog to write my thoughts but I never got time to start one. Recently I read a [blog](https://thecodeboss.dev/blog/) by [Aaron Krauss](https://thecodeboss.dev/about/) and I was impressed by the quality of content in his blog posts. I learnt so much from his blog than many books. This blog motivated me to start mine where I can write my thoughts and learning on topics such as 

* Java
* Containers
* Programming concepts
* Linux
* Python

I have started writing very recently and so please bear with my language.

**TL;DR:** Welcome to my blog. You can expect me to write on topics such as Java, Containers, Programming concepts, Linux and Python. I have started writing very recently so bear with my language.
