I am a Software Engineer at Oracle, interested in architecting and developing cloud-native web applications. In recent days I have developed an inclination towards machine learning and developing software applications that help us make smarter, more data-driven decisions.

**Areas of Interest:**
* Back-End Development (Java, Spring Boot, Jersey)
* Cloud Computing (Docker, Oracle CIoud Infrastructure)
* Machine Learning (Python, NLTK, Scikit learn)
